# Neurotechnology_Project
This is the repository for the neurotechnology &amp; BCI Lab project. 

## P300 Speller Interface
- Implemented an Open BCI framework for P300 detection, interfaced with a microcontroller interface, along with ensemble epoching and ML methods for dimensionality reduction and classification.
## Price Sensitivity Analysis
- Implemented Random Forest Classification using the Open Source NeuroMa Dataset for predicting Customer satisfaction associated with the product.
## ESP 32 Pulse Analysis Tool-Box
- Implemented a pulse characterization tool-kit (pulse potential, interval, duty cycle) for mitral valve simulator patented design along with power characterization for improvement of in-vivo performance of the valve.
